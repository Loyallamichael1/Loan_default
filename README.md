# Loan Default Prediction Project

## What This Project Is About

In this project, we used computers to guess if someone will pay back money they borrowed from the bank. We used something called Decision Trees to help banks make better choices when lending money.

## How We Got the Information Ready

- **Data**: We used facts about people like how much money they earn, how much they borrowed, their job, and if they paid back money in the past.
- **What We Did with the Data**:
  - Fixed any missing facts
  - Changed words into numbers that computers understand
  - Made sure all numbers were easy for computers to read
  - Looked at the data to find important clues

## How We Made Our Predictions

- **Models We Used**:
  - Decision Trees (like a flowchart that helps make decisions)
  - Logistic Regression (another way to guess)
  - Random Forest (lots of decision trees working together)

- **Making Models Better**:
  - We tested different settings to see what worked best.

## What the Results Mean

- **Important Clues**:
  - We found out what facts were most important in guessing if someone will pay back the money.

- **Decision Tree Picture**:
  - We drew a simple picture to show clearly how the choices were made.

## Checking How Well the Model Worked

- We checked using:
  - How often it was correct
  - How well it guessed who won't pay back money
  - How many good guesses it made overall

- We compared all models to find the best one.

## Why This Matters

- **Why It’s Important**:
  - This helps banks know who is safe to lend money to.

- **Our Ideas**:
  - We gave ideas to banks about how to pick the best people to lend money to.
  - We suggested ways banks can be smarter and safer with lending.
